Project 1 by Raman Srivastava 

Part 1: tagger.py Instructions:

Can Run the program using this Python command:
	"pyhton3 <corpus-train-path>"
	
	Example: 'python3 tagger.py "C:/Users/Ray/Documents/CS Assignments/CS 6320/Project 1/train"'
		     
		     (On Windows, use "python" instead of "python3" if that is your python3 installation)
	
1.) Requires python base install (no extra libraries used).

2.) <corpus-train-path> is the path of the corpus /train/ folder.

	NOTE* The train folder MUST have all 500 documents unzipped.
		  In the folder submitted, there is already a /train/ with the unzipped documents,
		  provide already for you.
		  
Part 2: PostRNN.ipynb Instructions:

0.) Go to Google Colab, sign in, and upload the "PostRNN.ipynb" file to open this Python Notebook.

	NOTE*: In cased you don't want to use Google Collan, the "PostRnn.py" file is provided for you.
	
	NOTE**: Make sure the "Hardware accelerator" is set to 'GPU' in Google Colab.
			The "Hardware accelerator" can be found in Runtime -> Change runtime type.
			
1.) Once uploaded in Google Colab, click on Runtime -> Run all and let the program execute.

	Note*: The PostRNN program requires a "train.zip" that contains a "/train/" folder with
		   all 500 (unzipped) documents. However, this file is automatically downloaded 
		   for you by the program with "wget.download(url, fileName)".
		   
		   In case the "wget.download(url, fileName)" line  does not work for whatever reason,
		   please uncomment and run the lines:
		   
		   # from google.colab import files
		   # files.upload()
		   
		   Then, upload the "train.zip" file provided in the folder submitted when Google Colab 
		   prompts you to.
